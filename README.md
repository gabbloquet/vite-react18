# Vite + React 18

## Introduction

[What is vite ?](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) :  is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
[React 18](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html) : improvements like automatic batching, new APIs like startTransition, and streaming server-side rendering with support for Suspense.

## How I started

1. `npm init vite@latest vite-react18 -- --template react-ts`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm install -E react-router-dom@5.3.0 @types/react-router-dom@5.3.3`
3. Update `react` & `react-dom` from [package.json](./package.json) to `^18.0.0`
